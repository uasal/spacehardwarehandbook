**Preview of The SpaceX Starship: General Consensus on Weights & Fuel, and Calculated ∆V**
The following memo describes characteristics of the SpaceX Starship that may be important to
the development of orbital trajectories. SpaceX has not released any finalized details on the vehicle’s
configuration as of this time, and a lot of the unofficial chatter on those details varies from week to
week. What I have accumulated here is the general consensus on certain fundamental values that
I have found in various reliable references, with those that have been repeated by more than one
source given primacy. I have also provided basic ∆V calculations based on those values, which can
act as a rough comparison when considering orbits and other options.
