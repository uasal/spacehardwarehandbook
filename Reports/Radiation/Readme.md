### Comparison of Orbital Proton Fluences For Proposed STP: Pearl Mission Orbits

This paper compares proton fluxes for four proposed STP:Pearl mission orbits: the OHB Aero-
space MEO orbit; the Molniya HEO orbit; the TESS P/2 HEO orbit, and the Spitzer Earth Trailing
orbit (ETO); for more detail on individual orbits, see the STP Orbital Comparison memo. The proton
fluences are the result of SPENVIS modeling, with the exception of the ETO, which is cited from
Spitzer data. Illustrations of the orbital paths and their proximity to the Van Allen Radiation Belts
are also presented.
