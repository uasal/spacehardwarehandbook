Simple rule-of-thumb for small assemblies: 

``The RMS vibration amplitudes were applied as a simulated 100g
static load applied along each axis simultaneously. This
load was chosen to be more conservative than the
requirements of the NASA General Environmental
Verification Specification (GEVS) which represents a
3-sigma case of applied acceleration due to launch-
induced vibrations.'' [do Vale Pereira, P. et al 2020 https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2020/all2020/121/]
